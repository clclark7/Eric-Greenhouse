# Smart Greenhouse Project Roadmap

Love you Dad

## 1. Define Your Requirements
- **List Sensors:**  
  Decide which parameters to monitor (e.g., soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity, water level).
- **Data Transmission:**  
  Confirm that you want sensor nodes to send data to a local dashboard.
- **Alerts & UI:**  
  Initially set up manual alerts and a basic web interface accessible via the ESP32’s IP.

## 2. Gather Hardware & Tools
- **ESP32 Development Board:**  
  Choose one that fits your needs.
- **Sensors:**  
  - Soil Moisture Sensors  
  - pH Sensors  
  - Temperature & Humidity Sensors (e.g., DHT22 or BME280)  
  - Water Level Sensors
- **Optional Multiplexer:**  
  If you need to read multiple analog sensors from one ADC channel, consider an analog multiplexer (e.g., CD74HC4067).
- **Other Supplies:**  
  Breadboard, jumper wires, resistors, and possibly enclosures for outdoor protection.
- **Development Tools:**  
  - Computer with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO installed  
  - USB cable for programming the ESP32

## 3. Set Up Your Development Environment
- **Install Software:**  
  Download and install the Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO) and add ESP32 board support.
- **Test the Board:**  
  Start with a simple “blink” program to confirm your ESP32 is working.

## 4. Prototype Sensor Connections
- **Start Small:**  
  Connect one sensor (e.g., a soil moisture sensor) to your ESP32.
- **Write Code:**  
  - Read sensor data using appropriate libraries (e.g., `analogRead` for analog sensors).  
  - Print sensor data to the Serial Monitor for testing.
- **Expand Gradually:**  
  Once one sensor is working, add additional sensors. Use a multiplexer if you run out of ADC channels.

## 5. Develop Wireless Communication
- **Wi-Fi Setup:**  
  - Connect your ESP32 to your local Wi-Fi network.  
  - Test sending simple data packets (e.g., via HTTP or MQTT) to a server or directly serving a webpage.
- **Local Dashboard:**  
  - Use the ESP32’s built-in web server capabilities to create a basic dashboard.  
  - Start with displaying sensor data on an HTML page.  
  - Add forms later to set manual alert thresholds.

## 6. Integrate and Test the System
- **Combine Sensor Data:**  
  Write code that gathers data from all sensors and updates the dashboard in real time.
- **Manual Alerts:**  
  - Implement simple logic that checks sensor values against predefined thresholds.  
  - Display alerts on your dashboard when sensor readings exceed these thresholds.
- **Field Testing:**  
  - Test the system indoors before deploying it in the greenhouse.  
  - Once stable, move the system to the greenhouse environment and ensure sensors are protected against the elements.

## 7. Iterate and Expand
- **Refine the UI:**  
  Improve the web dashboard for better visualization and user interaction.
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - Consider adding data logging (e.g., using an SD card or sending data to a Raspberry Pi for long-term storage).  
  - Explore integrating machine learning later on for predictive insights.
